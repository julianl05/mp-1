                        <p>Hi! My name is Julian Lim Jun Ren and I am currently a junior studying computer science at Boston University. 
                            Right now, my foremost career interest is web application development, as I hope to build software that will be used to impact the real world.
                            I'm also deeply passionate about the gaming industry, and as such I've spent much of my free time playing the newest games and keeping up to date with the latest news, trends, and technologies in the industry.
                        </p>
